<h1>DumbleDoor <i class="fas fa-door-open"></i></h1>
<h2>This website basically concentrates on the world's one of the leading problems - Pollution.</h2>
<p><strong>The door is named DumbleDoor which is a magical door that opens right into the solutions ;)
<br><br>The website potrays an animation of a moving car that produces smoke and when a magical wand is moved around it, all the smoke is vanished, just like that and therefore no smoke is entering the air.</strong> 
<br><br><span>Who knew a wand could eradicate air pollution, right? :)</span></p>
